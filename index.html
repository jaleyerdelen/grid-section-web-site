                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I
                    learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
                    joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.

                      ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the
                      bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a transition and have
                      heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I
                      signed up for the free intro course and found it
                      incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                      weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
                      Since completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched
                      careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                  >‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of
                  code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help
                  me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
                  by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
                  things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
                  not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
                  wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
                  particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
                  level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve
                  often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                  developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
                  full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                  recommend! ‚Äù</small
